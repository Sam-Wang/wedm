\acknowledgments

Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Prof. S. V. Kulkarni for his continuous support, patience and motivation. His guidance helped me in all the time with this project and writing of this thesis.

Besides my advisor, I would like to thank Prof. S. A. Khaparde, for arranging the funds for the Semikron IGBT modules. This assembly was crucial to the progress made in the fabrication of the Pulsed Power Supply.

My sincere thanks also goes to Makarand Kane and Abhishek Chanekar, who helped me through the roadblocks in the development of this project since the very beginning.

Last but not the least, I would like to thank the Insulation Diagnostics Lab, Control and Computing Lab, Wadhwani Electronics Lab and the Electrical Department office staff for providing excellent facilities.
